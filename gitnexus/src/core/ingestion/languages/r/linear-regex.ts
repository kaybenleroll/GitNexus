/**
 * A linear-time matcher for the regular-expression subset that `exportPattern()`
 * arguments use.
 *
 * `exportPattern()` text comes from the repository being analysed and is run against
 * every node name. Compiling it to a JavaScript `RegExp` lets a pattern such as
 * `^(a+)+$` take exponential time on a short name and hang the analyzer, whereas R
 * evaluates the same text with TRE, which does not backtrack. {@link compileLinearRegex}
 * parses the pattern (JavaScript syntax, non-Unicode mode, the dialect `RegExp`
 * accepted before) into a Thompson NFA and simulates it with a set of active states.
 * A match attempt costs O(name length x NFA size) whatever the pattern says, and the
 * total work one matcher may do is capped (see the cost model below).
 *
 * Supported: literals, `.`, bracket expressions, `\d \D \w \W \s \S \b \B`, the
 * single-character escapes, `^ $`, groups (capturing and `(?:)`), alternation and the
 * quantifiers `* + ? {n} {n,} {n,m}` (lazy forms behave identically for a yes/no
 * test). Not supported, and compiled to `null`: back-references and look-around (no
 * linear-time algorithm), named groups, legacy octal escapes, patterns longer than
 * {@link MAX_PATTERN_LENGTH} and patterns whose expansion exceeds {@link MAX_STATES}.
 * A syntax error also yields `null`. Matching is over UTF-16 code units, as
 * `RegExp` without the `u` flag does. {@link compileLinearRegexDetailed} reports why a
 * pattern was refused.
 *
 * Cost model. Compiling is O(pattern length + states). Matching one name is
 * O(name length x active states), and a state count alone does not make a pattern
 * slow: `[[:alpha:]]{1,2000}` has 4,000 states but one of them is active at a time,
 * and an alternation of literals keeps only the ones whose next character matches.
 * What is slow is many active states on a long name, and a repository controls both.
 * So the caps are sized for legitimate patterns and the hostile case is bounded
 * separately, by {@link MAX_TOTAL_WORK}: each matcher counts every state it visits
 * and, once the budget is spent, answers false for names it has not already decided
 * and reports `exhausted`. A visit costs 10-20 ns, so the budget is 0.4-0.8 s per
 * package however many names are tested: measured on the development machine, `a?`
 * repeated 500 or 8,000 times then `c`, `[A-Za-z]{1,2000}c`, and a 120-way alternation
 * of `a...ab` each exhaust it in ~0.4 s against 50,000 distinct 100-character names.
 * Realistic patterns stay far below it: 500 alternated identifiers, anchored or not,
 * cost about 20 visits per name, because alternatives that share a prefix share
 * states. Verdicts are memoised per distinct name, so a repeated name costs one lookup.
 *
 * The per-matcher cap does not bound how many matchers there are, and a NAMESPACE can
 * carry as many `exportPattern()` lines as it likes (200 hostile ones cost ~77 s). So
 * matchers may also draw on a {@link SharedWorkBudget}, which the caller creates once
 * for a whole package-config load and hands to every matcher it compiles, across all
 * the packages it discovers; a matcher stops when its own cap or the shared budget is
 * spent, whichever comes first. A count cap would not do: a per-package cap still
 * allows many packages, and a per-run cap would penalise a monorepo whose packages
 * each carry a few benign patterns, which use next to no work.
 *
 * Matching is not the only cost that grows with the number of patterns. Every compiled
 * pattern keeps an NFA (about 100 bytes a state), and a NAMESPACE can carry hundreds of
 * thousands of them, so the budget also holds an allowance of NFA states: a pattern that
 * does not fit in what is left is refused (the build stops at the allowance, so its NFA is
 * never allocated in full) and, once nothing is left, later patterns are refused without
 * being parsed (the first pattern that does not fit ends the allowance; a pattern is at most
 * {@link MAX_STATES} states, so that only happens after the allowance is nearly used up).
 * Budgets nest: a package's budget is a {@link SharedWorkBudget.child} of the
 * load's, so one package cannot take the whole load's allowance and leave every other
 * package's patterns unable to run.
